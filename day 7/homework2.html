    <h1><b>Ilia Chavchavadze</b></h1>
    <p> <b> Ilia Chavchavadze</b> was a <b>Georgian</b> public figure, journalist, publisher,
         writer and poet who spearheaded the revival of <b>Georgian nationalism</b> during the second half of the 19th century and ensured the survival of the <b>Georgian language</b>, 
         <b>literature</b>, and <b>culture</b> during the last decades of <b>Tsarist rule</b>. He is Georgia's <i>"most universally revered hero"</i> and is regarded as the <i>"Father of the Nation."</i></p>
    <P>He was a leader of contemporary youth intellectual movement named <I>"Tergdaleulebi"</I>. They spread modern and European liberal ideals in Georgia.
         Ilia Chavchavadze founded two modern newspapers: Moambe and Iveria. He played an important role in the creation of the first financial structure in Georgia - Land Bank of Tbilisi, with the aim of protecting Georgian land from being bought by Armenian bourgeoisie.
          During 30 years he was a chairman of this Bank, through which he financed and promoted most of the cultural, educational, economical and charity events which took place in Georgia.</P>
    <p>Continuing the educational work started in <b>Constantinople</b> by Fr. <b>Peter Kharischirashvili</b> and the <b>Servites of the Immaculate Conception</b>,
         Ilia Chavchavadze also participated in the foundation of <i>"Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians"</i> - an organization that established schools that taught in the Georgian language. 
         This was instrumental in halting the <b>Russification</b> policy of <b>Russian Empire</b> in Georgia.</p>
    <p>Inspired by the contemporary liberal and nationalist movements throughout Europe, Chavchavadze directed much of his efforts toward awakening national and liberal ideals among Georgians.
         Chavchavadze was the author of numerous articles that were published in his newspaper <b>Iveria</b>, as well as in other periodicals that were published in Georgia. In his articles, Chavchavadze discussed literature, education, theater, politics, economics, current affairs. His views on self-government,
          judicial system, social issues, human rights, women's rights, and civic activism were ahead of their time and contributed to Georgia's sense of national identity. He was a devoted protector of the <b>Georgian language</b> and <b>culture</b> from Russification. He coined the phrase <i>"Ena, Mamuli, Sartsmunoeba"</i> 
          , which is widely acknowledged slogan of <b>Georgian nationalism</b>.</p>
    <p>During the <b>1905 Russian Revolution</b> Chavchavadze was elected as a representative of the <b>Georgian nobility</b> to the imperial <b>State Council</b>. However, he stated that he would represent the whole nation, not just one particular social class. He advocated against <b>capital punishment</b> and lobbied for Georgian autonomy.</p>
    <p>Chavchavadze was killed in <b>Tsitsamuri</b>, near <b>Mtskheta</b>, by a gang of assassins. Details of his murder are still matter of debate. His legacy earned him the broad admiration of the Georgian people. In 1987 he was <b>canonized</b> as <b>Saint Ilia the Righteous</b> by the <b>Georgian Orthodox Church</b>. Today, <b>Georgians</b> revere Chavchavadze as <b>The Uncrowned King</b>  and the <i>"Father of the Nation."</i></p>
