    <h1>5 programming languages</h1>

    <h1>Python</h1>
    <P>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.</P>
    <p>Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,</p>
    <p>as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.</p>
    <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.</p>

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites.</p>
    <p>It achieves this by adding new HTML elements while modifying existing ones.</p>
    <p>Many coders enhance web development skills using JavaScript to create user-friendly and interactive websites.</p>

    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.</p>
    <P>It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built.</P>
    <p>New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.</p>

    <h1>C++</h1>
    <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language. C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
    <p>C++ is used in fields such as system software, game development, embedded systems, scientific computing and high-performance applications.</p>
    <p>The C++ standard library provides a range of coding utilities and functions, making it easy to develop complex software systems.</p>
